          1 Modular approach: The entire floating village consists out of multiple
          smaller floating units. They are connected to each other. Each unit can
          be constructed separately and adapted depending on the needs. Each
          platform can count several levels. The modular approach makes it
          possible for the village to expand incrementally.
